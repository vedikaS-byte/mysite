### hello world
I am an aspiring data scientist looking to pursue a career in climate tech and sustainability consulting. Having recently graduated with a B.S. in Environmental Science and an Applied Statistical Modeling Credential from UT Austin, Iâ€™m eager to integrate environmental and data science to develop data driven solutions for addressing climate change. 


I am passionate about protecting the planet for future generations by using data science applications to address climate change. I want to help guide other like-minded climate enthusiasts with understanding their emissions and potential reduction solutions.
