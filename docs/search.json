    "text": "GitHub Repository: https://github.com/vedikaS-byte/fire-scars-and-social-impacts-analysis\nIn January 2025, Los Angeles County experienced two catastrophic fires: the Eaton and Palisades Fires. Each fire burned nearly 10,000 acres and forced thousands of residents to evacuate (Neuman, 2025). Strong Santa Ana winds intensified the fires, complicating containment efforts, as the flames not only funneled through mountain passes but also spread over ridges and into surrounding basins (Neuman, 2025). The fires caused widespread displacement, killed at least 28 people, destroyed over 16,000 structures, and inflicted significant ecological damage (Phillips, 2025).\n Figure 1. Palisades Fires burning through a residential neighborhood in Los Angeles during high winds in early January (ABC News, 2025).\nThis blog post includes two main components: Visualizing Fire Scars with False Color Imagery and Exploring the Social Dimensions of Fire Impacts. It walks through how I applied geospatial analysis and worked with environmental datasets using Python libraries such as geopandas and xarray, including reassigning spatial reference information to ensure accurate georeferencing. In the second part, I explore how performing a spatial join and clipping can yield different results when relating geospatial datasets using socioeconomic data.\nThe final outputs include a false color map of the Palisades and Eaton fires created from remote sensing data to highlight fire scars and demonstrate how coding and data visualization can support environmental monitoring. I also created a map of census tracts showing households living below 200% of the poverty level within the affected areas to better understand the social impacts of each fire. I explored the difference between spatial joins and spatial clipping when linking geospatial datasets to a reference boundary, comparing both methods to determine which best represented the population living below 200% of the poverty line in each fire perimeter. The primary socioeconomic variable for this analysis comes from the 2024 Environmental Justice Index (EJI) geodatabase (EPL_POV200).\n\n\n\nRemote sensing allows for quantitative and spatial mapping of fire impact, and false color imagery provides detailed insight into vegetation changes. Using Python tools such as xarray and geopandas, the satellite raster data was processed to map fire-scar perimeters and generate true and false color imagery that clearly distinguishes burned areas from healthy vegetation, providing precise spatial context and improved interpretation of affected landscapes (Earth Observatory, 2025).\nThe coordinate reference system (CRS) is important when handling and mapping multiple geospatial objects to ensure accurate spatial analysis. When combining multiple geospatial datasets (ex. fire perimeters and satellite imagery), having consistent CRS prevents misalignment, ensures correct distance and area measurements, and allows layers to overlay properly on maps.\nGeospatial information can be assigned to an object using a spatial reference. In this analysis, the EPSG code embedded in the .spatial_ref.crs_wkt output was identified and used to properly assign and (if needed) reproject the dataset.\nPerforming a spatial join and clipping can produce different results. When an intersects spatial join between the census tracts and fire perimeters was performed, the output included entire census tracts that touched the fire perimeter, resulting in a larger extent. This differs from clipping, which would limit the output strictly to the area within the fire perimeter.\n\n\n\n\nThis analysis utilized three datasets. The first is a simplified set of satellite image bands (red, green, blue, near-infrared, and shortwave infrared) from the Landsat 8 satellite, downloaded from the Microsoft Planetary Computer and trimmed to the fire area. It is used only for visualization and learning and is provided as landsat8-2025-02-23-palisades-eaton.nc in the EDS 220 course resources.\nThe second dataset shows the burned areas for the Palisades and Eaton fires. The fire boundary shapefiles were downloaded from the County of Los Angeles Enterprise GIS. Each fire originally had daily mapped boundaries, which were combined (dissolved) into one final outline showing the total area burned by each fire (County of Los Angeles, 2025).\nThe third dataset contains 2024 socioeconomic data for California, downloaded as a geodatabase from the 2024 Environmental Justice Index (EJI). The dataset was downloaded from the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry and contains environmental, economic, and demographic data at the census track level."

I used the write_crs() function through the rio accessor to reattach the geospatial reference and project the Landsat data to EPSG:32611, which I identified from the NetCDF using spatial_ref.crs_wkt.\n\n# Call spatial_red.crs_wkt on NetCDF to access geospatial reference info\npalisades_eaton.spatial_ref.crs_wkt\n\n'PROJCS[\"WGS 84 / UTM zone 11N\",GEOGCS[\"WGS 84\",DATUM[\"WGS_1984\",SPHEROID[\"WGS 84\",6378137,298.257223563,AUTHORITY[\"EPSG\",\"7030\"]],AUTHORITY[\"EPSG\",\"6326\"]],PRIMEM[\"Greenwich\",0,AUTHORITY[\"EPSG\",\"8901\"]],UNIT[\"degree\",0.0174532925199433,AUTHORITY[\"EPSG\",\"9122\"]],AUTHORITY[\"EPSG\",\"4326\"]],PROJECTION[\"Transverse_Mercator\"],PARAMETER[\"latitude_of_origin\",0],PARAMETER[\"central_meridian\",-117],PARAMETER[\"scale_factor\",0.9996],PARAMETER[\"false_easting\",500000],PARAMETER[\"false_northing\",0],UNIT[\"metre\",1,AUTHORITY[\"EPSG\",\"9001\"]],AXIS[\"Easting\",EAST],AXIS[\"Northing\",NORTH],AUTHORITY[\"EPSG\",\"32611\"]]'\n\n\n\n# Assign the EPSG:32611 CRS to palisades_eaton \npalisades_eaton = palisades_eaton.rio.write_crs(32611)\n\n\n\nPart 3: Visualizing the Extent of Burns in False Color\nI utilized false color imagery to highlight the extent of the Palisades and Eaton fire scars in Los Angeles County by combining the shortwave infrared (swir22), near-infrared (nir08), and red bands. This view allowed burned areas and changes in vegetation to be more visible. Before plotting, I also ensured that all geospatial datasets shared the CRS by applying transformations with conditional statements as needed to prevent geospatial misalignment.\n\n# Landsat CRS is the reference CRS used for transformation\ncrs_raster = palisades_eaton.rio.crs\n\n# Transform to match CRS reference\nif palisades.crs != crs_raster: \n    palisades = palisades.to_crs(crs_raster)\n\n# Transform to match CRS reference\nif eaton.crs != crs_raster: \n    eaton = eaton.to_crs(crs_raster)\n\nIn the final step of my analysis, I created a map using this false color combination and included a figure description to explain how it highlights burned regions and vegetation patterns. At first, the image did not plot correctly due to missing (NaN) values in some bands; however, replacing those values with zeros using .fillna(0) and reducing the influence of outliers such as cloud cover with robust = True generated a corrected image that clearly outlines fire scars across the landscape.\n\n\nCode\n# Establish figure and axis\nfig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize = (8,10))\n\n# Define bands of interest\nbands = palisades_eaton[[\"swir22\", \"nir08\",\"red\"]].to_array().fillna(0)\n\nbands.plot.imshow(\n    ax = ax, # Assign axis\n    robust = True # No cloud cover\n    ) \n\n# Manually create patches for referencing fire perimeter in legend \npalisades_patch = mpatches.Patch(\n    facecolor = \"darkblue\", # Define border color (fill for patch)\n    label = \"Palisades Fire\") # Label reference\n\neaton_patch = mpatches.Patch(\n    facecolor = \"darkmagenta\", # Define border color (fill for patch)\n    label = \"Eaton Fire\") # Label reference\n\n# Plot each fire perimeter with same edgecolor as patch\npalisades.plot(ax = ax, # Reassign axis\n               facecolor = \"none\", # No fill color\n               edgecolor = \"darkblue\", # Border color\n               label = \"Palisades Fire\", # Label\n               linewidth= 1.5) # Adjust border thickness\n\neaton.plot(ax = ax, \n           facecolor = \"none\", # No fill color\n           edgecolor = \"darkmagenta\", # Border color\n           label = \"Eaton Fire\", # Label\n           linewidth = 1.5) # Adjust border thickness\n\n# Add legend \nax.legend( \n    handles = [palisades_patch, eaton_patch], # Pass list of patches\n    loc = \"upper left\") # Define location for legend\n\n# Set a title\nax.set_title(\n    \"False Color Satellite Imagery of Palisades and Eaton Fire Extents in Los Angeles County \\n(January 2025)\"\n)\n\n# Turn axis off for readability\nax.set_axis_off()\n\n# Show plot\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\nMap 1. False color imagery of Palisades and Eaton Fire extent in Los Angeles County (January 2025).\nThe produced map highlights the significant impact of the Palisades and Eaton Fires on vegetation density. In the burned areas, an orange coloration clearly contrasts with the surrounding greenery, indicating that the fires heavily affected forested regions. The Palisades Fire appears to have burned a larger area than the Eaton Fire, with more extensive vegetation loss within its perimeter. Additionally, the Palisades Fire is situated closer to the coast and urban areas, suggesting a potentially greater direct impact on people, though the Eaton Fire also affected populated regions.\nThe false color imagery uses the shortwave infrared (SWIR), near-infrared (NIR), and red bands to enhance contrasts in vegetation. For instance, mountainous areas outside the fire perimeters appear as dense light green, while urban regions are represented by clusters of white, likely indicating building presence. Within each fire perimeter, reduced vegetation density is highlighted in orange, clearly outlining burned areas from the surrounding greener regions."

    "section": "Visualizing Social Dimensions of the Fires",
    "text": "Visualizing Social Dimensions of the Fires\n\nPart 1: Spatial Joining vs Spatial Clipping\nA spatial join returns attributes from one or both GeoDataFrames based on their spatial relationship, such as whether features intersect, overlap, or are contained within one another; it merges attribute data using spatial rules. A spatial clip, on the other hand, simply limits one GeoDataFrame to the area defined by another. It cuts the geometries using a mask and returns only the attributes from the original dataset being clipped, without merging in new attribute information.\nTo visually understand the difference between clipping and spatial joining, I applied both methods to the census tracts in two subsections using the fire perimeters as the reference layer. Before proceeding, I verified that all geospatial layers were projected using the same CRS.\n\n# Reproject EJI to match Palisades CRS if needed\nif eji.crs != palisades.crs:\n    eji = eji.to_crs(palisades.crs)\n\n# Reproject EJI to match Eaton CRS if needed\nif eji.crs != eaton.crs:\n    eji = eji.to_crs(eaton.crs)\n\n\nSpatially Joining Census Tracts and Fire Perimeters\nIn this section, I explored and visualized spatial joins by using the EJI data with the Palisades and Eaton fire perimeters through sjoin().\n\n# Only include EJI census tracts that intersect the Palisades fire perimeter\neji_palisades = gpd.sjoin(eji, palisades, predicate = \"intersects\")\n\n# Only include EJI census tracts that intersect the Eaton fire perimeter\neji_eaton = gpd.sjoin(eji, eaton, predicate = \"intersects\")\n\n\n\nCode\n## Map the intersecting census tracts compared to the Palisades fire perimeter\n\n# Define figure and axis dimensions\nfig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize = (10,8))\n\n# Plot intersection of eji census tracts with palisades perimeter\neji_palisades.plot(ax= ax, edgecolor = \"black\",  facecolor = \"lightblue\", linewidth = 3)\n\n# Plot palisades perimeter (outlined in red) for reference\npalisades.plot(ax = ax, color = \"none\", edgecolor = \"red\", linewidth = 3)\n\n# Set title\nax.set_title(\"Census Tracts Affected by the Palisades Fire in LA County\")\n\n# Turn of axis ticks\nax.set_xticks([])\nax.set_yticks([])\n\n# Call plot\nplt.show()\n\n\n## Map the intersecting census tracts compared to the Palisades fire perimeter\n\n# Define figure and axis dimensions\nfig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize = (10,8))\n\n# Plot intersection of eji census tracts with eaton perimeter\neji_eaton.plot(ax= ax, edgecolor = \"black\",  facecolor = \"lightblue\", linewidth = 3)\n\n# Plot eaton perimeter (outlined in red) for reference\neaton.plot(ax = ax, color = \"none\", edgecolor = \"red\", linewidth = 3)\n\n# Set title\nax.set_title(\"Census Tracts Affected by the Eaton Fire in LA County\")\n\n# Turn of axis ticks\nax.set_xticks([])\nax.set_yticks([])\n\n# Call plot\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClipping Census Tracts to Fire Perimeters\nAn alternative to using a spatial join is clipping, which restricts one geospatial dataset to the extent of another. Here, I used geopandas.clip() instead of a spatial join to limit the census tracts to the boundaries of each fire.\n\n# Clip the census tracts to the extent of the palisades perimeter\neji_palisades_clip = gpd.clip(eji, palisades)\n\n# Clip the census tracts to the extent of the eaton perimeter\neji_eaton_clip = gpd.clip(eji, eaton)\n\n\n\nCode\n## Plot clipped census tracts to the Palisades fire perimeter\n# Define figure and axis\nfig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize = (10,8))\n\n# Plot clipped census tracts within the Palisades fire perimeter (filled in light blue, outlined in black)\neji_palisades_clip.plot(ax = ax, facecolor = \"lightblue\", edgecolor = \"black\", linewidth = 1, alpha = .6)\n\n# Plot palisades perimeter (outlined in dark red) for reference\npalisades.plot(ax = ax, color = \"none\", edgecolor = \"darkred\", linewidth = 3)\n\n# Set title\nax.set_title(\"CLIPPED Census Tracts Affected by the Palisades Fire in LA County\")\n\n# Turn off axis ticks\nax.set_xticks([])\nax.set_yticks([])\n\n# Call plot\nplt.show()\n\n## Plot clipped census tracts to the Eaton fire perimeter\n\n# Define figure and axis\nfig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize = (10,8))\n\n# Plot clipped census tracts within the Eaton fire perimeter (filled in light blue, outlined in black)\neji_eaton_clip.plot(ax = ax, facecolor = \"lightblue\", edgecolor = \"black\", linewidth = 1, alpha = .6)\n\n# Plot eaton perimeter (outlined in dark red) for reference\neaton.plot(ax = ax, color = \"none\", edgecolor = \"darkred\", linewidth = 3)\n\n# Set title\nax.set_title(\"CLIPPED Census Tracts Affected by the Eaton Fire in LA County\")\n\n# Turn off axis ticks\nax.set_xticks([])\nax.set_yticks([])\n\n# Call plot\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPart 2: Mapping Environmental Justice Data in Affected Areas\nClipping is preferred for visualizing census tracts based on social conditions within each fire perimeter because clipping limits the data to only the portions of census tracts that fall inside the fire boundaries, rather than including entire tracts that touch the perimeter. With an intersects spatial join, whole census tracts were returned even if only a small portion overlapped the fire area, which resulted in larger extents than the actual fire boundaries.\nHere, I mapped the clipped census tracts within each fire perimeter to visualize the varying percentages of the population in each tract living below 200% of the poverty line.\n\n\nCode\n# Create subplots for Palisades and Eaton fires\nfig, (ax1, ax2) = plt.subplots(1, 2, figsize=(20, 10))\n\n# Update eji variable\neji_variable = 'EPL_POV200'\n\n# Determine common min/max values for consistent color scale across both plots\nvmin = min(eji_palisades_clip[eji_variable].min(), eji_eaton_clip[eji_variable].min())\nvmax = max(eji_palisades_clip[eji_variable].max(), eji_eaton_clip[eji_variable].max())\n\n# Plot clipped census tracts within Palisades fire perimeter\neji_palisades_clip.plot(\n    column=eji_variable,\n    vmin=vmin, vmax=vmax,\n    legend=False,\n    ax=ax1,\n    cmap=\"inferno_r\"\n)\nax1.set_title('Palisades Fire', fontsize=18)  # Larger title\nax1.axis('off')\n\n# Plot clipped census tracts within Eaton fire perimeter\neji_eaton_clip.plot(\n    column=eji_variable,\n    vmin=vmin, vmax=vmax,\n    legend=False,\n    ax=ax2,\n    cmap=\"inferno_r\"\n)\nax2.set_title('Eaton Fire', fontsize=18)  # Larger title\nax2.axis('off')\n\n# Add descriptive title \nfig.suptitle(\n    'Comparison of Census Tracts by Population Below 200% Poverty Line\\nwithin Palisades and Eaton Fire Areas',\n    fontsize=20,\n    fontweight='bold'\n)\n\n# Add shared colorbar at  bottom\nsm = plt.cm.ScalarMappable(norm=plt.Normalize(vmin=vmin, vmax=vmax), cmap=\"inferno_r\")\ncbar_ax = fig.add_axes([0.25, 0.12, 0.5, 0.02])  # [left, bottom, width, height], adjust to raise y-axis \ncbar = fig.colorbar(sm, cax=cbar_ax, orientation='horizontal')\ncbar.set_label('Percentage of Population Below 200% Poverty Line', fontsize=14)\n\n# Add caption\nfig.text(\n    0.5, 0.01, # Adjust approximate position\n    \"Map 2. Census tracts in the Palisades and Eaton fire areas showing the percentage of population below 200% of the poverty line. Darker colors indicate higher poverty.\",\n    ha='center', # Position\n    fontsize= 12 # Adjust font size\n)\n\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\nThe figure indicates that the Palisades Fire disproportionately affected communities with lower poverty levels compared to communities with higher poverty levels. In contrast, only a single census tract impacted by the Eaton Fire had more than 70% of its population living below 200% of the poverty line. Notably, larger census tracts tended to have at least 30-40% of residents living in poverty. This suggests that higher-income communities, often located in wealthier neighborhoods, may have been more affected by the Palisades Fire. Additionally, within the Palisades Fire extent, census tracts further from the coastline generally exhibited higher poverty rates than those closer to the coast. For the Eaton Fire, poorer census tracts were more frequently found in the mountainous regions affected by the fire. Generally, the Eaton Fire affected census tracts with higher proportions of residents living below 200% of the poverty line compared to the Palisades Fire. Overall, the analysis demonstrates that the effects of wildfires can vary significantly depending on the socioeconomic characteristics of affected communities."

Aquaculture is defined as the organized cultivation, feeding, propagation, and production of aquatic organisms for commercial, recreational, or public use (Alleway et al., 2018). The aquaculture industry has significant potential to support food security while also contributing to conservation and economic development. In California, aquaculture is highly diverse in its production systems, cultured species, and final products, accounting for approximately 6% of the total value of the U.S. aquaculture industry (Wright et al., 2025). Wright et al. identify four main sectors within California aquaculture: finfish, shellfish, algae, and natural resource agencies. Finfish and shellfish production together represent more than 70% of the industry’s total value and primarily supply food for human consumption (Wright et al., 2025). As a result, commercial aquaculture has become an increasingly important and profitable source of marine food production in California.\n\n\n\nFigure 1.

Although oysters are relatively sturdy animals, they are sensitive to environmental conditions and are typically confined to sea surface temperatures (SSTs) between 11-30°C and water depths ranging from 0-70 meters below sea level (Oliver, 2025).

As such, identifying regions where their suitable environmental ranges overlap within Exclusive Economic Zones (EEZs) may help evaluate potential areas for sustainable and profitable aquaculture development.\n\n\n\nFigure 2.

The General Bathymetric Chart of the Oceans (GEBCO) is a global terrain model that provides geospatial information, such as elevation, for both ocean and land surfaces at a 15-arc-second grid resolution (GEBCO, n.d.). Bathymetry data for this analysis were downloaded from GEBCO as a tif file. This analysis also used satellite-derived average sea surface temperature (SST) data from 2008–2012 to characterize mean SST within each EEZ.

    "text": "Part 1: Map of Suitable Locations for Oyster Aquaculture\n\nData Preparation\nBefore beginning my analysis, I loaded the appropriate packages to properly read, manipulate, and work with geospatial data in formats such as sf, SpatRaster, and SpatVector. I used the vect() function to read in the West Coast EEZ shapefile as a vector layer. I imported the bathymetry dataset using the rast() function and stored it as a SpatRaster object. For the sea surface temperature (SST) data, I identified all .tif files using list.files() and combined them into a single raster stack with rast() for further analysis. I also included a conditional check that stops the code if character(0) is returned, indicating that no raster files were found in the directory and that an absolute file path should be specified.\n\n\nCode\n# Import packages\nlibrary(here) # Load \"here\" to locate and reference files\nlibrary(tidyverse) # Load the tidyverse\" for data cleaning\nlibrary(sf) # Load \"sf\" for GIS analysis\nlibrary(raster) # Load \"raster\" for accessing raster data types\nlibrary(ggplot2) # Load \"ggplot2\" for data visualization\nlibrary(tmap) # Load \"tmap\" for functions to create and layer maps\nlibrary(kableExtra) # Load \"kableExtra\" for table formatting\nlibrary(stars) # Load \"stars\" for integration with \"sf\"\nlibrary(terra) # Load \"terra\" for SpatVector and SpatRaster operations\n# knitr::opts_knit$set(root.dir = here::here(\"posts\", \"aquaculture-post\"))\n# getwd()\n\n\n\n\nCode\n# West Coast EEZ\neez &lt;- vect(here::here(\"posts\", \"aquaculture-post\", \"data_aqua\", \"wc_regions_clean.shp\"))\n\n# Bathymetry raster\ndepth &lt;- rast(here::here(\"posts\", \"aquaculture-post\",\"data_aqua\", \"depth.tif\"))\n\n\n\n\nCode\n# Create a list of the tiff files for SST\nsst_files &lt;- list.files( # Define file path\n  path = \"/Users/vedikashirtekar/Documents/MEDS/mysite/posts/aquaculture-post/data_aqua\"\n,\n  # Pattern matches all tiff files starting with   \"average_annual\"\n  pattern = \"average_annual.*\\\\.tif$\",\n  full.names = T \n)\n\n\n# Stop running if character(0) returned\nif (length(sst_files) == 0) {\n  stop(\"No SST raster files found in directory.\")\n}\n\n# Stack raster files\nsst &lt;- rast(sst_files)\n\n\nIt is critical to ensure that the coordinate reference system (CRS) of all geospatial objects match to avoid misalignment, inaccurate measurements, and errors during spatial analysis. Here, I used conditional statements with st_crs() to detect and resolve any CRS mismatches between spatial objects and to display a message when mismatches were found.\n\n\nCode\n# Create list of spatial objects\nspatial_objects &lt;- list(eez, depth, sst)\n\n# Use eez's CRS as reference\nref_crs &lt;- st_crs(spatial_objects$eez)\n\n# Check and transform each tile with if/else statements\nif (st_crs(spatial_objects$depth) != ref_crs) {\n  warning(\"depth CRS does not match. \n          Transforming to match eez CRS.\")\n  spatial_objects$depth &lt;- st_transform(spatial_objects$depth, ref_crs)\n} else {\n  message(\"depth CRS already matches eez CRS.\")\n}\n## depth CRS already matches eez CRS.\n\nif (st_crs(spatial_objects$sst) != ref_crs) {\n  warning(\"sst CRS does not match. \n          Transforming to match eez CRS.\")\n  spatial_objects$sst &lt;- st_transform(spatial_objects$sst, ref_crs)\n} else {\n  message(\"sst CRS already matches eez CRS.\")\n}\n## sst CRS already matches eez CRS.\n\n\n\n\nData Processing\nBefore combining the SST and depth data, it was necessary to conduct several preprocessing steps to ensure accurate spatial alignment and analysis. I first projected the depth dataset to match the SST CRS to ensure proper spatial alignment. Then, I created a single raster representing average SST from 2008–2012 using the mean() function and converted the average temperature from Kelvin to Celsius by globally subtracting 273.15 K from all raster values. To prepare the datasets for analysis, I ensured both rasters matched in terms of a shared CRS, resolution, and extent. Then, I cropped and resampled (resample()) the depth raster to the SST boundary to match the resolution of the average SST raster using the nearest neighbor method.\n\n\nCode\n# Reproject to match sst CRS\ndepth &lt;- project(depth, sst)\n\n# Calculate average SST among all rasters\navg_sst &lt;- mean(sst)\n\n# Update avg_sst in degrees Celsius\navg_sst &lt;- avg_sst - 273.15\n\n# Do the CRS match?\nmessage(\"Do the CRS match:\", crs(avg_sst) == crs(depth))\n## Do the CRS match:TRUE\n\n# Do the resolutions match (require resampling)? \nmessage(\"Do the resolutions match:\", res(avg_sst) == res(depth))\n## Do the resolutions match:TRUETRUE\n\n# Do the extents match?\nmessage(\"Do the extents match: \", ext(avg_sst) == ext(depth))\n## Do the extents match: TRUE\n\n\n\n\nCode\n# Use crop() to crop depth to the extent of avg_sst\ndepth_sst_crop &lt;- crop(depth, avg_sst)\n\n# Resample with nearest neighbor method\ndepth_sst_crop &lt;- resample(depth_sst_crop, avg_sst, method = \"near\")\n\n\n\n\nFinding Suitable Locations\nTo identify suitable aquaculture locations, I reclassified the average SST and depth rasters using oyster-specific temperature and depth thresholds in classify(), where suitable values were assigned a value of 1 and unsuitable values a value of 0. I then defined a function to combine both layers by multiplying the reclassified rasters to identify areas that met both environmental requirements. Finally, I stacked the reclassified SST and depth layers using lapp() and applied the function to generate a single binary raster showing overall suitability. The output raster avg_sst_depth is a SpatRaster with binary values of 0 and 1.\n\n\nCode\n# Preferred oyster range for SST: 11-30°C\n\n# Define reclass matrix for un/suitable SST\nreclass_matrix_sst &lt;- matrix(\n  c(-Inf, 11, 0, # Negative infinity (unbounded) to 11 degrees assigned 0\n    11, 30, 1, # 11-30 degrees assigned 1\n    30, Inf, 0), # 30 to infinity (unbounded) assigned 0\n  ncol = 3, # Create three columns\n  byrow = T # Fill by row \n)\n\n# Assign reclassified values to avg_sst\navg_sst_reclass &lt;- classify(avg_sst, rcl = reclass_matrix_sst)\n\n\n\n\nCode\n# Preferred oyster range for depth: 0-70 meters below sea level\n\n# Define reclass matrix for un/suitable depth\nreclass_matrix_depth &lt;- matrix(\n  c(-Inf, -70, 0, # -70 used for values below sea level\n    -70, 0, 1, # Suitable values assigned 1 for -70-0\n    0, Inf, 0), # &gt; 0 assigned unsuitable (0)\n  ncol = 3,# Create three columns\n  byrow = T # Fill by row  \n)\n\n# Assign reclassified values to depth\ndepth_reclass &lt;- classify(depth_sst_crop, rcl = reclass_matrix_depth)\n\n\n\n\nCode\n# Create multiplication function to reference in lapp\nmultiply &lt;- function(x,y){ \n  multi_raster &lt;- x*y # Raster multiplication across all cells\n  return(multi_raster)\n  }\n\n# Return suitable (1) and unsuitable (0) cells \navg_sst_depth &lt;- lapp(\n  x = c(avg_sst_reclass,depth_reclass), # Stack rasters\n  fun = multiply) # Apply multiplication function \n\n# Print binary raster \nplot(avg_sst_depth)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDetermining the Most Suitable EEZ\nIn order to rank EEZ zones by aquaculture potential, it was important to determine the total suitable area within each EEZ. I calculated the total suitable area within each zone, then projected the EEZ shapefile to match the CRS of the suitability raster (avg_sst_depth). I then utilized the ifel() function to identify suitable cells within the EEZs by reclassifying values of 0 as NA (unsuitable) and converting all remaining values to 1 (suitable), allowing only viable areas to be included in the following calculations.\n\n\nCode\n# Project\neez &lt;- project(eez, avg_sst_depth)\n\n# Select suitable areas\navg_sst_depth_suitable &lt;- ifel(avg_sst_depth == 0,\n                               NA, # Replace with NA\n                               1) # Otherwise assign \"1\"\n\n#avg_sst_depth[is.na(avg_sst_depth)] &lt;- 0\n\n\nNext, I calculated the total suitable aquaculture area (km²) within each EEZ by masking, calculating cell area, and summarizing suitability by region. It was necessary to rasterize the eez SpatVector because vector EEZ polygons must be represented in raster space to allow area summarization per region using raster-based functions. I utilized rasterize() to convert the EEZ polygons so that each raster cell was labeled by region, enabling area calculations with zonal statistics. Additionally, I created a mask to include only raster values within the EEZ regions, excluding any areas outside these boundaries. The resulting raster contained the surface area of each cell, calculated using cellSize(). Finally, I used zonal() to sum the area of suitable cells for each EEZ and joined the results back to the spatial reference dataset (eez_sf) to visualize the distribution of suitable aquaculture areas using tmap.\n\n\nCode\n# Rasterize eez regions\neez_rast &lt;- rasterize(eez, avg_sst_depth_suitable, \n                      field = \"rgn\") # By region\n# Identify suitable cells in mask \nsuitable_cells_eez &lt;-  mask(avg_sst_depth_suitable, eez)\n\n# Calculate cell areas (km^2)\ncell_area &lt;- cellSize(suitable_cells_eez, unit = \"km\")\n\n# Convert to sf object\neez_sf &lt;- st_as_sf(eez) # To have geometry\n\narea_eez &lt;- zonal(cell_area * suitable_cells_eez, # Identify area of suitable locations \n                  eez_rast, # Rasterized eez\n                  fun = \"sum\", na.rm = T) %&gt;%  # Sum areas of cells within each EEZ zone \n  rename(suitable_area_km2 = area) %&gt;% # Rename for naming conventions\n  as.data.frame() %&gt;% # Convert to data frame\n  left_join(eez_sf, by = \"rgn\") # Join on region\n\n# Convert back into sf so eez data (includes calculated suitable area) for mapping\narea_eez &lt;- area_eez %&gt;% st_as_sf()\n\n\n\n\nCode\n# Create map\noyster_pref_map &lt;- tm_shape(area_eez) +\n  tm_polygons(\n    \"suitable_area_km2\", # Color by suitable_area_km2 variable\n    palette = \"-mako\", # Reverse blue scale\n    style = \"cont\", # Continuous scale (styles referenced:\n    #https://r-tmap.github.io/tmap-book/visual-variables.html)\n   title = expression(\"Suitable Area\"~\"(\"~ km^2~\")\"), # Rename legend title\n  colorNA = \"transparent\",\n  textNA = \"\",\n  #legend.na.show = FALSE\n  ) +  \n  \n  tm_text(\"rgn\", # Label by region\n          size = .5, # Adjust size\n          col = \"white\", # Adjust text color\n          fontface = \"bold\",  # Labels are bolded\n          xmod = -.5) + # Adjust .5 from the left\n  \n  tm_layout( # Center title outside bounding box\n    main.title = \"Marine Aquaculture Suitability for Oysters in West Coast EEZs\",\n     main.title.size = 1.2, # Adjust title size\n    legend.outside = TRUE, # Place legend outside map frame\n    legend.outside.position = \"right\", # Place legend to right\n    component.autoscale = FALSE, # Disable autoscaling for title\n    outer.margins = c(0.01, 0.25, 0.01, 0.05) # Manually adjust map frame\n    ) + \n  \n   tm_scale_bar( # Add scale bar for scale\n     position = c(-.01, 0.08),   # Move 1% from left and 8% from bottom \n     breaks = seq(0, 500, 150)) + # Establish scale bar ranges\n\n     tm_compass( # Add compass for orientation\n     type = \"4star\",        \n     position = c(\"right\", \"top\")) + # Adjust position\n  tm_basemap(\"Esri.OceanBasemap\") # Ocean basemap\n\n# Print map\noyster_pref_map\n\n\n\n\n\nMap 1.

    "text": "Part 2: Generalized Function of Aquaculture for Species Preferences\nThe workflow observed in Part 1 is applicable to any species of interest to generate maps of suitable aquaculture areas within West Coast EEZs based on species-specific temperature and depth ranges. To make this process reproducible, I created the species_preference function to streamline identification of suitable zones for any species. The function takes minimum and maximum SST values, minimum and maximum depth limits, and a species name as inputs, and returns a map of EEZ regions shaded by total suitable area.\nIt is important to note that species_preference performs calculations only based on the specific inputs provided, such as reclassification and average SST conversion. Therefore, I reloaded all spatial objects and verified that they shared the same CRS to ensure they were correctly prepared for processing within the function.\n\n\nCode\n# Load in data again\n\n# West Coast EEZ\neez &lt;- vect(here::here(\"posts\", \"aquaculture-post\", \"data_aqua\", \"wc_regions_clean.shp\"))\n\n# Bathymetry raster\ndepth &lt;- rast(here::here(\"posts\", \"aquaculture-post\",\"data_aqua\", \"depth.tif\"))\n\n# Create a list of the tiff files for SST\nsst_files &lt;- list.files( # Define file path\n  path = \"/Users/vedikashirtekar/Documents/MEDS/mysite/posts/aquaculture-post/data_aqua\"\n,\n  # Pattern matches all tiff files starting with   \"average_annual\"\n  pattern = \"average_annual.*\\\\.tif$\",\n  full.names = T \n)\n\n\n# Stop running if character(0) returned\nif (length(sst_files) == 0) {\n  stop(\"No SST raster files found in directory.\")\n}\n\n# Stack raster files\nsst &lt;- rast(sst_files)\n\n\n\n# Create list of spatial objects\nspatial_objects &lt;- list(eez, depth, sst)\n\n# Use eez's CRS as reference\nref_crs &lt;- st_crs(spatial_objects$eez)\n\n# Check and transform each tile with if/else statements\nif (st_crs(spatial_objects$depth) != ref_crs) {\n  warning(\"depth CRS does not match.

    "text": "Reflection\nFor oysters species along the West Coast, Central California is the most suitable EEZ with about 3,656.82 km2 of suitable area while Northern California is the least suitable EEZ with about 194.13 km2 of suitable area. Central California likely offers the most favorable SST and depth conditions for oyster cultivation. Notably, the Washington EEZ has a larger suitable area (1,028.90 km²) than Northern California despite its colder location, indicating a higher proportion of habitat appropriate for mollusk aquaculture. Central and Southern California also show relatively high suitability. Oregon’s EEZ contains substantial suitable area as well, though less than most other regions.\nThe red abalone, a critically endangered marine gastropod, is a commercially valuable species with strong potential for aquaculture. The Washington EEZ appears especially promising for red abalone cultivation, with more than 1,500 km² of suitable area, likely due to the colder water temperatures preferred by the species. Interestingly, Central and Southern California also contain substantial suitable areas that exceed those of Northern California, despite being further south and having generally warmer conditions; differences in coastal upwelling and nutrient availability may explain this pattern. Red abalone aquaculture also represents a model for sustainable seafood production. For instance, the Monterrey Abalone Company in Central California raises abalone in both marine and land-based systems with minimal use of chemicals and antibiotics (Bailey, 2015). Overall, red abalone farms highlight opportunities for environmentally responsible aquaculture while supporting production in the most suitable West Coast EEZs, particularly in Washington, Central California, and Northern California.\nSeveral considerations exist for future analysis. The analysis considers the average annual SST and depth, but does not account for seasonal variation that may influence species suitability. Additionally, the species_preference function considers only temperature and depth ranges; other ecological or biological factors (ex. salinity and predation) are not included and are thus simplified. The accuracy of the EEZ polygons are important as they affect results. For example, misaligned or outdated boundaries could mislead researchers into incorrect area calculations. Therefore, an improved analysis would incorporate flexibility for complex species preferences to avoid oversimplification and ensure that geospatial objects are properly aligned, yielding more accurate results."

    "text": "I’ve always been drawn to nature. Growing up in Arizona and Texas, and now living in California, I’ve experienced a wide range of climates and landscapes that have shaped my appreciation for the natural world. With a deep familial connection to the ocean, I’m especially motivated to better understand and protect the environments we depend on. This curiosity ultimately led me to pursue environmental science and explore data-driven approaches to sustainability, especially in reducing greenhouse gas emissions."
